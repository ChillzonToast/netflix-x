# Netflix-X

## üé¨ Introduction

**Netflix-X** is a movie streaming web application built as part of my second Capstone project. It's also the first project I‚Äôve fully developed using Git and GitHub. As a movie enthusiast, I chose this project idea because it felt the most rewarding and aligned with my interests.
