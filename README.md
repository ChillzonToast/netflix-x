# Netflix-X

## Introduction

A project I am developing solely for educational purposes. This is my second Capstone project and the first one to be developed through github and git. I love movies and so I thought this project would make me feel the most satisfied than my other ideas.

## Installation

The project uses OMDB api and TMDB api for fetching data. Create a secrets.json file in the home directory containing the api keys in the format:
```
{
    "imdbApiKey":"YOUR_OMDB_API_KEY",
    "tmdbApiKey":"YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY"
}
```
Install the packages using npm:
```
npm install
```

And you're done.
